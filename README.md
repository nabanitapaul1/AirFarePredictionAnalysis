AIR Fare Prediction Analysis
Business objective- To predict airfare, as domestic air travel is popular these days in India with different air ticket booking channels, travelers are trying to make sense and understand how airlines price their tickets over time. 
We want you to explore previous airfare data and build a model to predict the price fluctuations over time so that the consumer could benefit from it. We want you to identify dependency over many endogenous variables. You are free to look at different models from the space of forecasting and regression.
